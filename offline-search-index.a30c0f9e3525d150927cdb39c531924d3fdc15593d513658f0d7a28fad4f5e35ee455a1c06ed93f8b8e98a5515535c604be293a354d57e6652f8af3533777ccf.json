[{"body":"BeatVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Beat Saber mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Beat Games or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations BeatVortex is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods or maps from archive files works, deploying directly to your install directory. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Finding new mods: Using the \u0026ldquo;Get more mods\u0026rdquo; menu in Vortex to download mods should automatically install them with Vortex saving a few clicks. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods or songs and quickly switch between them. One-click installs: There is some very early preview support for one-click installs from BeatSaver allowing you to install and manage songs easier than ever.  There's a few things that anyone used to other tools might miss though, as we haven't implemented them yet:\n Dependencies: Vortex's support for dependencies is\u0026hellip;.sketchy. BeatVortex doesn't support dependencies right now so make sure you install any dependencies. Previews/metadata: Vortex regards songs as just another type of mod, so you won't expect the level of details, stats or previews that something like BeatDrop gives you. Error Handling: BeatVortex's error handling is pretty barebones. You might see more errors and odd behaviours during installs.   If you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the BSMG Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using BeatVortex) does not mean that mods or songs will be available on Nexus Mods, nor does Nexus Mods officially support Beat Saber. BeatVortex itself includes support for BeatMods and BeatSaver/BeastSaber, but Nexus does not host Beat Saber mods. See the FAQ for extra details.\n","excerpt":"BeatVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods with Vortex.

Remember, these docs are also open-source and contributions are always welcome!\n","excerpt":"This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods …","ref":"/docs/","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.\nWhy do I need Vortex for this? You don't! If you prefer using any of the other community-provided mod tools (like Mod Assistant), I recommend using them! In fact, Mod Assistant provides a few features that BeatVortex/Vortex (or Nexus Mods) simply doesn't support, including dependency resolution.\nBeatVortex is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already.\nWhy not just use Mod Assistant? See above ⬆. Use what you prefer! Prefer the familiarity of Vortex? Use BeatVortex. Prefer the extra features of Mod Assistant? Use that. Got your own set of tools? Use those.\nIn fact, generally speaking, you should be able to use BeatVortex alongside those other tools without any major problems.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex? They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the root of the archive should end up at the root of the install directory (for mods, not maps), and that’s basically it.\n A special note for BeatSaver maps: if users download a map from BeatSaver and install it with BeatVortex, it will actually hit BeatSaver's API to get the proper name to keep those mod lists neat. The directory in the install folder will have a terrible name, though.\n Why can’t I download mods from the Nexus? Nexus Mods doesn’t support Beat Saber mods (and most likely never will), so you will not be able to download mods from the Nexus website. You can, however, download from BeatMods or BeatSaver and install in Vortex.\nWhy aren't dependencies supported? This answer is a little technical, and driven by two different problems: Vortex support and the BeatMods API.\nIn short, Vortex doesn't really natively support dependency resolution for mods. Vortex's dependency management pretty much only works with Nexus Mods, meaning BeatVortex would have to do a lot of dependency logic during install, which leads to the other problem.\nThe BeatMods API, for reasons likely lost to time, returns dependencies from the API in a super-weird way: top-level dependencies are fine, but their dependencies are only returned as document IDs, meaning we can't easily go from a single API call to a full dependency tree.\nWhy aren't updates supported? This has the same two problems as dependencies: Vortex and BeatMods\nVortex does natively support updates, but at current the only update implementation available (that I know of) is using Nexus Mods, which we obviously don't have. That means having to reverse engineer how Nexus handles triggering mod updates which is a) an absolute shitton of work and b) difficult with BeatMods.\n The Nexus integration for Vortex is over 4000 lines of code. If anyone wants to volunteer to work out how the fuck that works, I'd be happy to accept PRs!\n ","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.\nWhy do I need Vortex …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Installing BeatVortex There's a couple of different ways to install BeatVortex! Unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nMost of the steps shown below will require Advanced Mode to be enabled in Vortex!\nEnable it in the Settings window, under Interface \u0026gt; Advanced \u0026gt; Enable Advanced Mode.\n Automatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Beat Saber Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you're ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you're ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you don’t want to enable Advanced Mode for Vortex or want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-beatsaber with three files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have three files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;your-user-name-here\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\gameart.png With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the Beat Saber icon in the Games screen light up.\n","excerpt":"Installing BeatVortex There's a couple of different ways to install BeatVortex! Unless you've got a …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installing BeatVortex"},{"body":" BeatVortex 0.2.1 (and later) includes beta support for prompting when an IPA patch is needed and automatically running it.\nIf you haven't already run IPA for your current install, you should be prompted to run it after your first deploy.\n At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, just without the convenience of installing from Nexus Mods. Make sure you've added Beat Saber as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the Beat Saber icon under Unmanaged\n There's a few main ways to install mods:\n OneClick installspreview BeatMods Browser Download in Vortex Install from archives  OneClick Installationpreview One-click installation of custom songs from BeastSaber, BeatSaver or ModelSaber requires first enabling it in your Vortex profile settings.\n Enabling one-click installs in Vortex will most likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling one-click installs!\n From the Profiles menu on the left, click the Edit button on your current profile (generally called Beat Saber - Default), and check the box to \u0026ldquo;Enable Vortex to handle Mod Assistant One-Click links\u0026rdquo;.\nYou then need to restart Vortex (sorry!) and you're good to go. Open up BeatSaver/BeastSaber/ModelSaber and click any of the OneClick install links: Vortex should pick up the link in the background, fetch the song details and download the map (or mod) directly into your mod list. Install and Enable as per usual to deploy into your game.\nA note on ModelSaber installs Since ModelSaber models are not distributed as archives but just raw files, Vortex will warn you and will create a mod archive with just that one file. All of Vortex's install and deployments logic really works best with archives.\nBeatMods Browser If you're looking to install any of the mods listed on BeatMods, you can easily do so from the BeatMods page in the sidebar (available from v0.2.0 onwards). This will list all approved mods for your current game version and you can quickly install them using the Ready to Install button on the right.\nNote that since Vortex can't tell which Beat Saber versions are mod-compatible (i.e. 1.8.0 mods work in 1.9.0), you may have to manually choose a version using the switcher at the top of the page to see all available mods.\n BeatVortex doesn't install dependencies for mods as Vortex doesn't natively support this and dependency resolution for BeatMods is\u0026hellip;complicated. You will need to manually install any dependencies, which are listed at the bottom of the mod description.\n Download in Vortex Once you've added Beat Saber, you can jump over to the usual Mods screen using the menu on the left. You might not have any mods here, but if you click on the But don't worry, I know a place\u0026hellip; dropdown, you'll get the choice of installing from BeatMods, BeatSaver or BeastSaber.\n This option will move to the Get more mods drop-down after you have installed your first mod.\n You can browse mods using the built-in browser that appears and if you download the ZIP archive of any song (from BeatSaver/BeastSaber), mod (from BeatMods), or model (from ModelSaber), Vortex will attempt to install it in the background for you. Close the browser to go back to your mod list then Install and Enable your mods as usual to use them in-game.\nInstall from archives You can also download mod/map archives directly from BeastSaber, BeatSaver, BeatMods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from archives will often not include the full metadata so mods may be confusingly named. Double-click the mod in the mod list to change its name.\n Please note that \u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo; mods that aren't packaged in an archive (for example, the dll files provided by some GitHub projects) will not work properly. Only archives are supported at this time.\nUpdating Mods At current, BeatVortex doesn't provide any update capability for Beat Saber mods. That being said, BSIPA should automatically keep your mods updated on launch. Pending some changes to Vortex (and potential future reworks of BeatMods), we aim to add some improved updates support in future releases.\n","excerpt":"BeatVortex 0.2.1 (and later) includes beta support for prompting when an IPA patch is needed and …","ref":"/docs/usage/mods/","title":"Installing Mods"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods with Vortex. For help with Vortex, check out the Vortex Support page.\n Ready to get started with BeatVortex? Awesome!\nIn general terms, you need to install the extension, then install some mods and you're ready to play!\n","excerpt":"This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods …","ref":"/docs/usage/","title":"Usage"},{"body":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes etc) using Vortex's built-in sidebar. Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you'll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It's not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.\nProfiles Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Don't want your streaming mods enabled when you're offline? Set up two profiles and switch over when you're playing with an audience. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking Add \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber\u0026rdquo; Profile.\n Please note that one-click installs will only be enabled at startup if the current profile has it enabled in the profile settings.\n Removing or resetting BeatVortex If you want to completely reset BeatVortex so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you've done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose Remove from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the \u0026ldquo;Beat Saber - Default\u0026rdquo; profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that Beat Saber will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.\nTo remove BeatVortex entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. BeatVortex will appear near the end of the list as \u0026ldquo;Game: Beat Saber\u0026quot;. Click Remove to uninstall BeatVortex.\n Note that Beat Saber will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.\n ","excerpt":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes …","ref":"/docs/usage/configuration/","title":"Configuration"},{"body":"BeatVortex is fully open-source!

I'll happily take fixes, though! Working with Vortex is weird: There's quite a few quirks of the codebase that exist because of unfathomably mystifying behaviour in Vortex's extension API. There are definitely missing edge cases: This started out as a basic prototype, so error handling and edge cases are definitely not at the standard we'd like.
