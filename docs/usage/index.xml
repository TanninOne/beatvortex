&lt;h2 id="installing-beatvortex">Installing BeatVortex&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There's a couple of different ways to install BeatVortex! Unless you've got a pretty specific use case, you'll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="automatic-installation">Automatic Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the easiest way to install!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click &lt;strong>Find more&lt;/strong> to open the list of Extensions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find &lt;strong>Beat Saber Support&lt;/strong> and click &lt;em>Install&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for the extension to install and &lt;strong>restart Vortex&lt;/strong> when prompted.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../install_1.png" alt="installation process">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you're ready to &lt;a href="../../docs/usage/mods">install some mods&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="semi-automatic-installation">Semi-Automatic Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you can't install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download the archive from &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">Nexus Mods&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://https://github.com/agc93/beatvortex/releases">GitHub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the Extensions panel in Vortex&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on the &lt;em>Drop File(s)&lt;/em> box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for the extension to install and &lt;strong>restart Vortex&lt;/strong> when prompted.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you're ready to &lt;a href="../../docs/usage/mods">install some mods&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="manual-installation">Manual Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Only attempt this if you &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, download the archive from &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">Nexus Mods&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://https://github.com/agc93/beatvortex/actions">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named &lt;code>game-beatsaber&lt;/code> with four files inside:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>info.json&lt;/li>
&lt;li>index.js&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gameart.png&lt;/li>
&lt;li>beatModsList.scss&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: &lt;code>%APPDATA%/Vortex&lt;/code> and then opening the &lt;code>plugins&lt;/code> directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you’re done, you should have four files at the following locations:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">C:\Users\&amp;lt;your-user-name-here&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Vortex\plugins\game-beatsaber\info.json
C:\Users\&amp;lt;your-user-name-here&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Vortex\plugins\game-beatsaber\index.js
C:\Users\&amp;lt;your-user-name-here&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Vortex\plugins\game-beatsaber\gameart.png
C:\Users\&amp;lt;your-user-name-here&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming\Vortex\plugins\game-beatsaber\beatModsList.scss
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With those files in place, you're clear to start Vortex and you should see the Beat Saber icon in the Games screen light up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Installing Mods</title><link>/docs/usage/mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/usage/mods/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>BeatVortex 0.2.1 (and later) includes beta support for prompting when an IPA patch is needed and automatically running it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven't already run IPA for your current install, you should be prompted to run it after your first deploy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, just without the convenience of installing from Nexus Mods. Make sure you've added Beat Saber as a managed game in Vortex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the &lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong> button on the Beat Saber icon under &lt;em>Unmanaged&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There's a few main ways to install mods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>OneClick installs&lt;sup>&lt;em>preview&lt;/em>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BeatMods Browser&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download in Vortex&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install from archives&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="oneclick-installationsuppreviewsup">OneClick Installation&lt;sup>&lt;em>preview&lt;/em>&lt;/sup>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One-click installation of custom songs from BeastSaber, BeatSaver or ModelSaber requires first enabling it in your Vortex profile settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Enabling one-click installs in Vortex will most likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling one-click installs!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>From the Profiles menu on the left, click the &lt;em>Edit&lt;/em> button on your current profile (generally called &lt;strong>Beat Saber - Default&lt;/strong>), and check the box to &amp;ldquo;Enable Vortex to handle Mod Assistant One-Click links&amp;rdquo;. If you don't have a Profiles menu, enable Profile Management from the settings screen under &amp;ldquo;Interface&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You then need to restart Vortex (sorry!) and you're good to go. Open up BeatSaver/BeastSaber/ModelSaber and click any of the OneClick install links: Vortex should pick up the link in the background, fetch the song details and download the map (or mod) directly into your mod list. Install and Enable as per usual to deploy into your game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a-note-on-modelsaber-installs">A note on ModelSaber installs&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Since ModelSaber models are not distributed as archives but just raw files, Vortex will warn you and will create a mod archive with just that one file. All of Vortex's install and deployments logic really works best with archives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beatmods-browser">BeatMods Browser&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you're looking to install any of the mods listed on BeatMods, you can easily do so from the BeatMods page in the sidebar (available from v0.2.0 onwards). This will list all approved mods for your current game version and you can quickly install them using the &lt;em>Ready to Install&lt;/em> button on the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that since Vortex can't tell which Beat Saber versions are mod-compatible (i.e. 1.8.0 mods work in 1.9.0), you may have to manually choose a version using the switcher at the top of the page to see all available mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>BeatVortex doesn't install dependencies for mods as Vortex doesn't natively support this and dependency resolution for BeatMods is&amp;hellip;complicated.
You will need to install any dependencies, which are listed at the bottom of the mod description, and in the Mods list.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="download-in-vortex">Download in Vortex&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you've added Beat Saber, you can jump over to the usual Mods screen using the menu on the left. You might not have any mods here, but if you click on the &lt;em>But don't worry, I know a place&amp;hellip;&lt;/em> dropdown, you'll get the choice of installing from BeatMods, BeatSaver or BeastSaber.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This option will move to the &lt;em>Get more mods&lt;/em> drop-down after you have installed your first mod.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can browse mods using the built-in browser that appears and if you download the ZIP archive of any song (from BeatSaver/BeastSaber), mod (from BeatMods), or model (from ModelSaber), Vortex will attempt to install it in the background for you. Close the browser to go back to your mod list then Install and Enable your mods as usual to use them in-game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="install-from-archives">Install from archives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can also download mod/map archives directly from BeastSaber, BeatSaver, BeatMods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the &lt;em>Install From File&lt;/em> button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Be aware that installing from archives will often not include the full metadata so mods may be confusingly named. Double-click the mod in the mod list to change its name.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Please note that &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; mods that aren't packaged in an archive (for example, the dll files provided by some GitHub projects) will not work properly. Only archives are supported at this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updating-mods">Updating Mods&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At current, BeatVortex doesn't provide any update capability for Beat Saber mods. That being said, BSIPA &lt;em>should&lt;/em> automatically keep your mods updated on launch. Pending some changes to Vortex (and potential future reworks of BeatMods), we aim to add some improved updates support in future releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If BSIPA installs an update for a mod, the version you see in-game and the version you see in Vortex might not be the same anymore. Reinstall the updated mod from Vortex if you want the numbers to match.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Docs: Configuration</title><link>/docs/usage/configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/usage/configuration/</guid><description>
&lt;h3 id="customising-metadata">Customising metadata&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes etc) using Vortex's built-in sidebar. Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you'll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It's not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="profiles">Profiles&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Don't want your streaming mods enabled when you're offline? Set up two profiles and switch over when you're playing with an audience. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking &lt;em>Add &amp;ldquo;Beat Saber&amp;rdquo; Profile&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Please note that one-click installs will only be enabled at startup if the &lt;em>current&lt;/em> profile has it enabled in the profile settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="removing-or-resetting-beatvortex">Removing or resetting BeatVortex&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want to completely reset BeatVortex so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you've done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose &lt;em>Remove&lt;/em> from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Beat Saber - Default&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that Beat Saber will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To remove BeatVortex entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. BeatVortex will appear near the end of the list as &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Game: Beat Saber&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;. Click Remove to uninstall BeatVortex.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Note that Beat Saber will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="purging-to-default">Purging to default&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want to take your game back to a default, unmodded state, you can use Vortex's &lt;em>Purge&lt;/em> feature. Click the Purge Mods button from the Mods list and Vortex will undeploy all your enabled mods, leaving your game directory essentially unmodded.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should be prompted to revert BSIPA patching when you purge, and prompted to rerun patching when you next deploy mods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Docs: Installing Playlists</title><link>/docs/usage/playlists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/usage/playlists/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>BeatVortex 0.3.1 or later is required to install playlists using Vortex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're currently using Beatlist for playlists, see below for extra information.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Playlist support in BeatVortex is very new and very experimental! The notion of playlists isn't something that easily maps into the Vortex way of handling things so there might be some rough patches.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beatlist">Beatlist&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you're currently using Beatlist for managing your playlists, I &lt;em>strongly&lt;/em> recommend sticking with it! BeatVortex will likely never support the same features as Beatlist, nor have the same level of polish or user-friendliness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do want to use Vortex to manage your playlists, just be aware that enabling playlist handling in your Vortex profile will stop Beatlist from automatically handling playlist install links (it will also prevent Mod Assistant from handling them).. You &lt;strong>should&lt;/strong> be able to continue using Beatlist to view and manage your playlist library, but this has not been tested (at all!) and might lead to some weirdness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modassistant">ModAssistant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you're currently using Mod Assistant to install your playlists, you should be aware of a few things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enabling playlist link handling in your Vortex profile will likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling those links&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Installing a playlist with Vortex will separately install each song in the playlist as a manageable mod in Vortex. Your mod list could get very long, very fast.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
